## TASKS

### Placements
##### You are given three tables: Students, Friends and Packages. 
Students contains two columns: ID and Name. 
Friends contains two columns: ID and Friend_ID (ID of the ONLY best friend). 
Packages contains two columns: ID and Salary (offered salary in $ thousands per month).

### New Companies
Amber's conglomerate corporation just acquired some new companies. Each of the companies follows this hierarchy:
1. Founder
2. Lead menager
3. Senior menager
4. Menager
5. Employee


Given the table schemas below, write a query to print the company_code, founder name, total number of lead managers, total number of senior managers, total number of managers, and total number of employees. Order your output by ascending company_code.

Note:

    The tables may contain duplicate records.
    The company_code is string, so the sorting should not be numeric. For example, if the company_codes are C_1, C_2, and C_10, then the ascending company_codes will be C_1, C_10, and C_2.

### Binary Tree Nodes
You are given a table, BST, containing two columns: N and P, where N represents the value of a node in Binary Tree, and P is the parent of N.

Write a query to find the node type of Binary Tree ordered by the value of the node. Output one of the following for each node:

    Root: If node is root node.
    Leaf: If node is leaf node.
    Inner: If node is neither root nor leaf node.

### Weather observation station 19

Consider and to be two points on a 2D plane where are the respective minimum and maximum values of Northern Latitude (LAT_N) and

are the respective minimum and maximum values of Western Longitude (LONG_W) in STATION.

Query the Euclidean Distance between points
and and format your answer to display 4 decimal digits.

### Symmetric pairs
You are given a table, Functions, containing two columns: X and Y.
Two pairs (X1, Y1) and (X2, Y2) are said to be symmetric pairs if X1 = Y2 and X2 = Y1.

Write a query to output all such symmetric pairs in ascending order by the value of X. List the rows such that X1 ≤ Y1. 

### Top earners
We define an employee's total earnings to be their monthly salary * months worked, and the maximum total earnings to be the maximum total earnings for any employee in the Employee table. Write a query to find the maximum total earnings for all employees as well as the total number of employees who have maximum total earnings. Then print these values as space-separated integers.

### Ollivander's inventory
Harry Potter and his friends are at Ollivander's with Ron, finally replacing Charlie's old broken wand.

Hermione decides the best way to choose is by determining the minimum number of gold galleons needed to buy each non-evil wand of high power and age. Write a query to print the id, age, coins_needed, and power of the wands that Ron's interested in, sorted in order of descending power. If more than one wand has same power, sort the result in order of descending age.
